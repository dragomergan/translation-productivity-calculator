Welcome to the Translation Productivity Meter
The project has been developed by Huseyin Mergan for his TR48A: Translation Tools class at Bogazici University Department of Translation and Interpreting Studies.

Instructions
Step 1: Preparing the Translations
You can upload an Excel file and ask your users either to post-edit or translate from scratch. Follow these steps to prepare the Excel file:

Prepare the translation in an Excel file in XLSX format with Source text in column B.
Reserve column A for any meta info.
Add the first version of the translation (or raw machine translation) in column C if you want it post-edited or reviewed.
Save the file as XLSX.
Here you can find a sample file.
Example Table
Task	English	Raw
FPE	C# and .NET, the technologies underlying Unity scripting, have continued to receive updates since Microsoft originally released them in 2002	Unity komut dosyalarının temelini oluşturan teknolojiler olan C # ve .NET, Microsoft bunları ilk olarak 2002'de yayınladığından beri güncellemeleri almaya devam etti.
Translation	But Unity developers may not be aware of the steady stream of new features added to the C# language and .NET Framework	
LPE	That's because before Unity 2017.1, Unity has been using a .NET 3.5 equivalent scripting runtime, missing years of updates.	Bunun nedeni, Unity 2017.1'den önce, Unity'nin .NET 3.5'e eşdeğer bir komut dosyası çalıştırma zamanı kullanması ve yıllardır süren güncellemeleri kaçırmasıdır.
Step 2: Importing Translations
Note: Please note that uploaded translations and final outputs are not saved into our server. Web app doesn't record any data from your end.
Click Import Translation button below to upload a file.
Select the file in the dialogue window.
Confirm the selected file by clicking OK. Note that you can only import one file at once.
Congratulations, all the translations are imported.
Step 3: Editing Translations
Now that you have imported the translations, you can start translating and/or editing text.

Translations are listed in a table.
If column C is populated, the first version column is also prefilled.
In this case, you can post-edit/review the translation.
Wherever column C is empty in the Excel, the first version column is filled with "undefined".
To edit a translation or translate the source, click "Start" button.
You can directly start typing in the first version column.
When done with editing, click "Save" and then move to the next row.
If you move to the next row before clicking save, it will keep counting the time until you click Save.
The time between clicking Start button and Save button is recorded in the Time Spent column.
To edit a previous row, click Start again and save your translation.
The time spent will be updated.
To delete a former translation from the first version column, click "Clear".
Step 4: Downloading the Translation
When done with all the rows, you can download the translation by clicking "Download Table as HTML".
